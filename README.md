# DarkPass

DarkPass is a custom dark mode theme for KeePass. It requires you to have the "KeeTheme" plugin installed. You can download the KeeTheme plugin on the official KeePass website or alternativly click this link: https://keepass.info/plugins.html#keetheme

# Installation
1. Download the "KeeTheme"-Plugin (link above) and put all the files in the plugins folder of KeePass. Your plugins folder should then contain the following files: KeeTheme.dll, KeeTheme.plgx
2. Now download the `KeeTheme.ini` file and put it in the plugins folder with both of the other files.
3. Restart KeePass
4. Select `Tools` -> `Dark Mode by Nobri` or press `Ctrl + T`
5. Enjoy

# Note
KeePass was created using standard Windows controls, which unfortunately were not designed for easy customization. It is really difficult to change their appearance, especially from a plugin which has no control over their creation. So some menus might look weird or you won't be able to see text properly.
